# Description
Every well done project needs a README file that highlights and effectivly shows what the project is what and what it can do. Key questions must be answered throught the project aswell such as: What is this app for? How do I use this app? How do I install this app? How do I make contributions to this app? Who do I contact if I have any questions on how this app works and how can they contribute to this app? This README generator is designed to help out developers do just that.

Open a preview of your new README and ensure that everything is spelled correctly and that the links to your GitHub page and email work otherwise you will need to run the application again and reinput the correct information.
